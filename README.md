# 🧵 Parallel Merge Sort with Threads (C++)

This project implements a **Parallel Merge Sort** algorithm using C++11 `std::thread`, designed to improve performance on large datasets through multithreading. It also includes a traditional Merge Sort for benchmarking and comparison.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Recursive Merge Sort Implementation**
- ⚡ **Parallel Sorting using `std::thread`**
- ⏱️ **Time benchmarking** using `std::chrono`
- 📊 **Performance comparison** between single-threaded and multi-threaded merge sort
- ✅ Clean class-based architecture
